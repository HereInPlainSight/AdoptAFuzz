AdoptAFuzz is a Bukkit plugin designed to allow flexibility in ownership of pets without requiring commands.  At the time of this writing the only command is to reload the plugin's config file with '/adoptafuzz'.

AdoptAFuzz allows customization of economy costs, item costs, along with whether or not all pets that breed's offspring are born wild and untamed, without ownership.
